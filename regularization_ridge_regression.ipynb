    "This section introduces a classic technique to combat the overfitting observed in Part 1 and the numerical instability from Part 2 by adding a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Objective:** To control model complexity and prevent overfitting using **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**, while understanding how regularization restores numerical stability.\n",
    "* **Methodology:**\n",
    "    1.  Modify the loss function to include a penalty term: $\\text{Loss} = \\text{MSE} + \\lambda ||\\beta||_2^2$.\n",
    "    2.  Implement the analytical solution for Ridge: $\\beta = (X^T X + \\lambda I)^{-1} X^T y$.\n",
    "    3.  Observe how the fitted model and its test error change as the regularization strength hyperparameter ($\\lambda$) is varied.\n",
    "    4.  Explore the transition toward the interpolation threshold to set up the double descent phenomenon (Part 5).\n",

    "### Synthesis Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization as Numerical Stabilization**: The $\\lambda I$ term transforms an ill-conditioned problem (Part 2) into a well-conditioned, strictly convex optimization problem. The condition number reduction demonstrates how Ridge restores numerical stability that the Normal Equation $(X^T X)^{-1}$ lacked.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regularization as Complexity Control**: The penalty term constrains model complexity, preventing overfitting in the classical regime (p < n). The U-shaped test error curve shows the bias-variance tradeoff in action, with optimal $\\lambda$ balancing fit and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Interpolation Threshold**: As p approaches n, unregularized OLS becomes unstable (as seen in the exploding test MSE), but Ridge remains stable. This transition point is where the classical bias-variance analysis begins to break down, foreshadowing the double descent phenomenon (Part 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Connection to Part 2**: Regularization provides an analytical solution to the numerical instability that made the Normal Equation fail. The pseudoinverse (Part 2) was a workaround; Ridge is a principled solution that modifies the optimization problem itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Foreshadowing Part 4**: Iterative optimizers (Part 4) will solve the same regularized problem using gradient descent, Newton's method, and L-BFGS. The implicit bias of these algorithms relates to regularization's explicit bias, providing complementary perspectives on complexity control.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Foreshadowing Part 5**: The primary visualization (Test MSE vs Degree) shows the classical U-shape where regularization helps. Beyond the interpolation threshold (p > n), we will observe in Part 5 that test error can decrease again—the double descent phenomenon—challenging conventional wisdom about the bias-variance tradeoff.\n"
